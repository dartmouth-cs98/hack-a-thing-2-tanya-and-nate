# Hack-A-Thing 2: React-native Readme
## Nate and Tanya, January 2020
### Thing Description:
We did a few different tutorials to learn different aspects of react-native that could be useful for our project.

### Who Did What:
Tanya built the ISS Imagery app that allowed users to interact with different images, with the help of the tutorial, and also tried to build a a Property Finder app that lets users search for different houses by location using an API.

### What We Learned:
We learned different key elements of react-native such as how to use states and APIs. We learned how to read errors and debug them (the errors were different to things we have been exposed to in the past). We also learned how to make UIs take user inputs which was something we will need for our project.

### What Didn't Work:
The property finder app didn't fully work because of a token error that we couldn't figure out fully. We were able to see the API and search functionality was working but couldn't get the final product to work fully because of unresolved errors.

### How it relates to our project:
The different tutorials all relate to our project in that they utilize react-native, which is what we intend on using to build our IOS app. We played with interactive images and user inputs amongst other things to practice building basic elements that we will need to use in our app. Learning how to deal with errors and debugging our code was useful practice that should come in handy with our project as well.
