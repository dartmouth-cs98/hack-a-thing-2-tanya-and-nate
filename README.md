# Hack-A-Thing 2: React-native Readme
## Nate and Tanya, January 2020
### Thing Description:
We did a few different tutorials to learn different aspects of react-native that could be useful for our project.

### Who Did What:
Tanya built the ISS Imagery app that allowed users to interact with different images, with the help of the tutorial, and also tried to build a a Property Finder app that lets users search for different houses by location using an API.

Nate built the TargetSum app and the Bakesale app which were both from a tutorial recommended by our project-mate Avery Vanacore. TargetSum is a very simple game in which users are provided with 6 numbers and a target number to sum to. Bakesale is an app that allows users to scroll through available deals provided on the internet and checkout those that they are interested in. 

### What We Learned:
We learned different key elements of react-native such as how to use states and APIs. We learned how to read errors and debug them (the errors were different to things we have been exposed to in the past). We also learned how to make UIs take user inputs which was something we will need for our project.

### What Didn't Work:
The property finder app didn't fully work because of a token error that we couldn't figure out fully. We were able to see the API and search functionality was working but couldn't get the final product to work fully because of unresolved errors.

We also struggled with the animation aspects of the Bakesale app and ended up having to refer heavily to the tutorial in order to get it looking good. We furthered the appearance of the TargetSum app but also lost some functionality (for example, the user shouldn't be able to continue pressing other numbers once they have won or lost).

### How it relates to our project:
The different tutorials all relate to our project in that they utilize react-native, which is what we intend on using to build our IOS app. We played with interactive images and user inputs amongst other things to practice building basic elements that we will need to use in our app. Learning how to deal with errors and debugging our code was useful practice that should come in handy with our project as well.
